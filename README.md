# Termux Discord Bot
Private Discord Bot for the [Termux Discord Server](https://discord.gg/HXpF69X)

Written in Lua using [Luvit](https://luvit.io) and [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia)

This is my first time using Discordia or even luvit so I expect very bad code here as I try to get comfortable to write the perfect command handler. So if you came for discordia examples, I don't recommend taking any inspirations from this code at this time, it may change a lot.

## Running
Fill `config.json` (see `config.json.example` for what to include)

```
$ lit install SinisterRectus/discordia
$ lit install SinisterRectus/sqlite3
$ luvit main.lua
```

No hosting support will be provided, this is a private bot.
